## Using online resources for running SQL Code
To practice coding in SQL, you can either use any online compiler you like or use the link https://sqliteonline.com/ to code SQL in class. You can create an account on this website to save the code we practice in class. 

Create a new database in SQLite using "+" sign on the top left bar.

If you have a SQL server and Workbench installed, you can even use that for practicing SQL code.
